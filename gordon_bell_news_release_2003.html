<BODY class=content text=#000000 bgColor=#ffffff><B>Top Researchers, 
Accomplishments in High Performance Computing Honored at SC2003</B> 
<P>Gordon Bell Awards, HPC&amp; Bandwidth Challenges, Best Papers and Poster 
Winners Announced</P>
<P>PHOENIX, Ariz (Nov. 21, 2003) - Top researchers and their unprecedented 
accomplishments in high performance computing were recognized at the SC2003 
conference this week, where the winners of the Gordon Bell Prizes, the HPC 
Challenge, and the best research papers and poster were announced. SC2003, the 
annual conference of high performance computing was held from November 15-21 in 
the Phoenix Convention Center with the theme "Igniting Innovation."</P>
<P>Every year, SC2003 presents a wide range of awards that recognize the 
innovative work of conference participants and leaders in the field. The 
conference itself gives awards for Best Paper, Best Student Paper, Best Poster, 
and the HPC Challenge and Bandwidth Challenge. In addition, SC2003 serves as the 
venue for presenting the Gordon Bell Prizes, which reward practical uses of 
high-performance computers, including best performance of an application and 
best achievement in cost-performance. Additionally, two special awards are 
presented by the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) to 
recognize longtime innovators in high-performance computing.</P>
<P>The 2003 IEEE Seymour Cray Award was presented to Burton J. Smith, chief 
scientist for Cray Inc. The Seymour Cray Award honors individuals whose 
innovative contributions to high performance computing systems best exemplify 
the creative spirit demonstrated by Seymour Cray. Smith is a co-founder of Cray 
Inc. and has been chief scientist and a director since early 1988. He is a 
recognized authority on high performance computer architecture and programming 
languages for parallel computers. He is the principal architect of the MTA 
system and heads Cray's Cascade project. Smith was honored in 1990 with the 
Eckert-Mauchly Award given jointly by the IEEE and the Association for Computing 
Machinery, and was elected a fellow of both organizations in 1994. In February 
2003 he was also elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering. 
</P>
<P>The IEEE's 2003 Sidney Fernbach Award as presented to Jack Dongarra, a 
professor at the University of Tennessee and adjunct R&amp;D participant at Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory and adjunct professor at Rice University. The award, 
established in 1992 in memory of Sidney Fernbach, one of the pioneers in the 
development and application of high performance computers, is awarded for 
outstanding contributions in the application of high performance computers using 
innovative approaches. Dongarra, who is well-known for his work with the 
twice-yearly ranking of the world's Top 500 supercomputers, specializes in 
numerical algorithms in linear algebra, parallel computing, use of 
advanced-computer architectures, programming methodology, and tools for parallel 
computers. His research includes the development, testing and documentation of 
high quality mathematical software. He has contributed to the design and 
implementation of the following open source software packages and systems: 
EISPACK, LINPACK, the BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, Netlib, PVM, MPI, NetSolve, and 
ATLAS.</P>
<P>The Gordon Bell Prizes are traditionally granted in three categories: special 
accomplishment based on innovation; peak performance based on operations per 
second; and a price per performance ratio measured in megaflop/s per dollar. 
Winners depend on the entries received; in some years a prize is not awarded in 
a given category. This year's Gordon Bell Prizes were for:</P>
<P><B>Peak Performance:</B> "A 14.6 Billion Degrees of Freedom, 5 Teraflop/s, 
2.5 Terabyte Earthquake Simulation on the Earth Simulator." Authors: Dimitri 
Komatitsch, Chen Ji, and Jeroen Tromp (California Institute of Technology); and 
Seiji Tsuboi (Institute for Frontier Research on Earth Evolution, JAMSTEC). The 
researchers used 1,944 processors of the Earth Simulator to model seismic wave 
propagation resulting from large earthquakes. The model, based on a very 
high-resolution mesh, incorporates wave speed and density structure, 
three-dimensional wave-speed and density structure, ellipticity, topography, and 
bathymetry.</P>
<P><B>Special Achievement:</B> "High Resolution Forward and Inverse Earthquake 
Modeling on Terascale Computers." Authors: Volkan Akcelik, Jacobo Bielak, 
Ioannis Epanomeritakis, Antonio Fernandez, Omar Ghattas, Eui Joong, Julio Lopez, 
David O'Hallaron, and Tiankai Tu (Carnegie Mellon University); George Biros 
(Courant Institute, New York University); and John Urbanic (Pittsburgh 
Supercomputing Center). For earthquake simulations to play an important role in 
the reduction of seismic risk, they must be capable of high resolution and high 
fidelity. The researchers developed earthquake simulation algorithms and tools 
and used them to carry out simulations of the 1994 Northridge earthquake in the 
Los Angeles Basin using 100 million grid points.</P>
<P><B>Special Achievement ("lifetime"):</B> "Performance Evaluation and Tuning 
of GRAPE-6—Towards 40 'Real' Tflop/s." Authors: Junichiro Makino and Hiroshi 
Daisaka (Department of Astronomy, School of Science, University of Tokyo); 
Eiichiro Kokubo (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan); and Toshiyuki 
Fukushige (Department of General System Studies, College of Arts and Sciences, 
University of Tokyo). The researchers benchmarked GRAPE-6, a sixth-generation 
special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body problems, and presented the 
measured performance for a few real applications with a top speed of 35.3 
teraflops.</P>
<P>The SC2002 Conference also selected several outstanding award winners for 
research papers and activities presented during the meeting.</P>
<P><B>Best Paper Award:</B> "The Case of the Missing Supercomputer Performance: 
Achieving Optimal Performance on the 8,192 Processors of ASCI Q." Authors: 
Fabrizio Petrini, Darren Kerbyson, and Scott Pakin (Los Alamos National 
Laboratory). The researchers described how they improved the effective 
performance of ASCI Q, the world's second-fastest supercomputer. Using an 
arsenal of performance-analysis techniques including analytical models, custom 
microbenchmarks, full applications, and simulators, they succeeded in observing, 
identifying, and eliminating a serious—but previously undetected—performance 
problem.</P>
<P><B>Best Student Paper:</B> "A New Parallel Kernel-Independent Fast Multipole 
Method." Authors: Lexing Ying, George Biros, Denis Zorin, and Harper Langston 
(New York University).</P>
<P><B>Best Student Poster:</B> "Improving the Performance of MPI Derived 
Datatypes by Optimizing Memory-Access Cost." Authors: Surendra Byna and Xian-He 
Sun (Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago); William Gropp and Rajeev Thakur 
(Argonne National Laboratory).</P>
<P>The HPC Challenge Awards recognize participants in two categories for 
innovative uses of high performance computing resources. Those included:</P>
<P><B>The HPC Challenge Award for the Most Geographically Distributed 
Application:</B> "Global Analysis of Arthropod Evolution," by Craig Stewart 
(UITS, Indiana University), John Colbourne (Center for Genomics and 
Bioinformatics, Indiana University) and their team.</P>
<P><B>The HPC Challenge Award for Most Innovative Data-Intensive 
Application:</B> "Transcontinental RealityGrids for Interactive Collaborative 
Exploration of Parameter Space (TRICEPS)," by Stephen Pickles (University of 
Manchester), Peter Coveney (University College London) and their team. </P>
<P>SC2003 continues the 15-year Supercomputing Conference tradition of 
highlighting the most innovative developments in high-performance computing and 
networking. Bringing together scientists, engineers, researchers, educators, 
programmers, system administrators and managers, SC2003 in Phoenix demonstrated 
how these developments are sparking new ideas and new industries, as well as 
rekindling older ones. The conference features the latest scientific and 
technical innovations from around the world, while its SC Global events will 
showcase achievements in the arts and sciences among dozens of remote 
locations.</P>
<P>Next year, SC2004 will be held November 6-12 at the David L. Lawrence 
Convention Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The series of SC conferences is 
sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer 
Society and by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group 
on Computer Architecture.</P></BODY></HTML>
